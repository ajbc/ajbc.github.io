Dear Ms. Chaney;

Greetings from a retired educator and 'computer guy' in western Canada.

Your Avro Arrow page is very interesting.  There are two entirely different versions of the aircraft.  One is real and the other imaginary.  Virtually all on-line material such as that on the Wiki refers to the imaginary version!

The real Arrow was built by always British-owned Avro Canada and was cancelled for reasons of economy [nearly five times the price of a Voodoo interceptor] and performance [only about two-thirds the range of a Voodoo].  This Arrow was only capable of continuous Mach 1.9 speeds.

The other version is an imaginary all-Canadian Mach 2.0+/2.5+/3.0+/5.0+/3.5+ [it just keeps on getting better with time] aircraft that was created as part of an anti-conservative political propaganda campaign.

The lies have become so common now that Canadian students are being taught in grade school that President Eisenhower and his evil American lackeys conspired with Prime minister Diefenbaker to murder our wonderful unicorn, the Avro Arrow.  This was supposedly done because Eisenhower knew that Canada would rule the world with such a machine. The truth is that Ike never did anything to harm Canada and was always a good friend.  He deserves to be remembered that way.

In our trade the computing machines have many sub-systems for detecting and correcting internal errors but on-line sources do not seem to have any such ability with content.  Today, after more than fifty years of listening to the Avro myth the vast majority of Canadians do believe the Avro Arrow was the best aircraft ever made in the history of the universe.  The wiki reflects this mistaken belief and so do most other on-line sources.

They need to do a better job of detecting and correcting factual errors.

What to think about errors in on-line sources?

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely yours,
