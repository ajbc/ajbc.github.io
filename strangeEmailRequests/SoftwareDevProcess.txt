Sear Mrs. Chaney,

upon preparing a talk about generalized language design, I came across your pages about the Software Development Process. I am looking for an UML model for this activity, i.e. recursive application of UML to the actors involved in the SDP.

Did you think about that or do you have a reference for such a model?

Best Regards
