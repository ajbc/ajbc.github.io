subject: May Bombing of Libya be featured on a list of Top Sites on 20th Century Military History? 

Hello Allison
 
I write for <site removed> and I'm currently compiling a list of great sites about U.S. military history, with a focus on major conflicts in the 1900s. I think Bombing of Libya would be a great fit for the piece!

Many of our readers are either currently in the military, or thinking about going into military service. We feel that understanding U.S. military history is essential for anyone who is a member of our armed forces. Military actions today will have a profound impact on our future, and learning from the past can help provide much needed perspective. Would it be alright to include your site on the list?

I'm still searching for other comprehensive sites on U.S. Military history to include as well, so if you know of any that you would like to recommend, please let me know.

Respectfully,
