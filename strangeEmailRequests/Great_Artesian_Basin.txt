Good morning.  I'm a science reporter for the public radio program called "The World" -- a BBC world service program that airs nationally in the US about international news (theworld.org).

Last month I traveled to Australia to report on a few stories, including one on the Great Artesian Basin.  I was hoping to check a few facts with you.  We're looking to wrap the story up, so if you're able to reply today, that would be great!  Here are the facts:

+ The Great Artesian Basin is an aquifer â€“ a thick slab of sandstone soaked through with water.
+ Is it fair to characterize this water as ancient rainwater that fell mostly in eastern Australia?
+ I'd like to say something about the debate between just how ancient the water is.  I'd like to say: "Some scientists say the water being used today has been down in the Earth for a million years.  Others say a thousand years."  Is that okay?
+ Also, does this read okay to you? : "Early settlers dug a lot of wells and let the water gush out over the land.  That wasted water and caused the pressure in the aquifer to drop."

And then a couple of quick questions:
+ Why is the water in the Great Artesian Basin so hot?  And why is it under pressure (so that often it doesn't require pumping to the surface)?

Thank you very much,
