										<h2>Letters of Recommendation</h2>
									</header>

                                    <p><em>Inspired by <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/bstewart/recommendation">Brandon Stewart's letter of recommendation instructions</a>.</em></p>

                                    <h3>Am I the right person?</h3>
                                    <p>First, make sure you ask yourself if I am the right person to write your letter. Have we had some substantial interaction (TA, RA, co-author, advisee etc.)? Is there something unique that I can attest to? The best letters are those which can share some unique information about the candidate. Thus you probably only want me to write a letter if we have had enough experiences together that I will be able to offer that perspective.</p>

                                    <h3>What to do?</h3>
                                    <p>If you still think I am the correct person, send me an email as soon as you know you will want the letter along with the deadline(s). In a timely fashion, please followup with the following information:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>the deadline and procedure for submitting the letter;</li>
                                        <li>any special requirements of the letter (length restrictions, criteria for what is to be covered etc.);</li>
                                        <li>a summary memo (explained below);</li>
                                        <li>PDF versions of all documents you are sending to the organization (e.g. CV, research proposals, personal statements, transcripts, test scores); and</li>
                                        <li>optionally, any excellent examples of your work (a great paper/final project/etc.).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Summary Memo</h3>
                                    <p>A summary memo is <b>not</b> a draft letterâ€”it is a set of bullet points that you want in my mind as I write. Please do send me an actual PDF though as it is easier to keep track of than an email. Please include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>a brief statement about who else is writing your letters and what if anything that you are hoping my letter will speak to that your other writers cannot;</li>
                                        <li>any application specific-requirements or suggestions about what the letter should contain;</li>
                                        <li>a short description of how you are pitching yourself or your research;</li>
                                        <li>anything you want me to highlight, especially relevant anecdotes that illustrate characteristics of you or your work (now is not the time for modesty!);</li>
                                        <li>plausible explanations for anything negative in your record, if any; and</li>
                                        <li>anything you don't want me to forget (don't assume I will remember things if you exclude them).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Timelines</h3>
                                    <p>Please give me as much lead time as possible (minimum 2 weeks!).  Sending me a reminder a week before the deadline would be advisable. My assistant or I will send confirmation once the letter has been submitted.  If you haven't received a confirmation (or can't see it in the system), please don't assume it has been sent.  Professors send a lot of these all about the same time so it is easy for things to be lost.</p>
